                    Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm CÃ©sar, Nonix's administrator and friend. I'm a
                    bit reserved and don't usually talk much.<br />
                    About me: I'm from Peru ðŸ‡µðŸ‡ª. I personally don't play many
                    games beyond Cities: Skylines, Phasmophobia, Euro Truck, and
                    of course, playing with Nonix and the rest of the team. I
                    like Chinese and Peruvian food, and Inca Kola.

                    Hi, I'm Katzuna, one of the Administrators of the YouTube
                    channel, one of the Owners of the Discord server, and a
                    friend of Nonix.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    When it comes to moderation, I like when people follow the
                    rules; if there are clear rules, I'll do everything possible
                    to ensure everyone adheres to them strictly (although I try
                    not to come across as too severe so that no one feels
                    uncomfortable speaking in chat when I'm around).
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    And about me: I'm from Chile, and I speak Spanish and
                    English (although I prefer Spanish). I enjoy playing video
                    games like Minecraft (especially doing stuff with commands
                    and datapacks), Geometry Dash, Phasmophobia, Ultrakill, The
                    Binding of Isaac, Celeste, Undertale/Deltarune, and, on rare
                    occasions, Fortnite and PUBG (only with my friends, as I
                    don't really like that kind of game). I also like subjects
                    such as maths, chemistry, and physics, among others. I'm not
                    really a fan of listening to music or watching series or
                    movies. I consider myself a pretty boring and bad-tempered
                    person, although I'm trying to change. I really don't like
                    using my voice, so if you see me in a voice channel or
                    something similar, don't expect me to speak. I prefer using
                    a bot that reads what I write.

                    Once upon a time, there was a man named Nodarwin. He saw a
                    cartoon called "The Amazing World of Gumball." Since his
                    favorite character is Darwin, he gave himself that username,
                    and that's what they call him today. Most importantly, I
                    like Pastel de papa.

                    Hey there! I'm Joaco, I don't really have a role assigned
                    here, but let's just say I'm Nonix's dev, and IRL friend.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I'm from Chile ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡±, so of course I speak Spanish, but I also
                    speak English, a little bit of German and know some words in
                    Latin.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    As far as programming goes, I love C, started with Java,
                    hate weakly typed languages (too easy tbh) and really like
                    long projects (they keep me entertained).
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    For gaming I really enjoy games that are chill, shooters, or
                    scary. A few of the games I play include Valorant, MC,
                    R.E.P.O., Phasmophobia and Lethal Company.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Some of my hobbies are: programming, listening to music,
                    gaming, watching shows, and designing circuits.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    And some of my favourite conversation themes are: math
                    (mostly algebra and trig), physics, anything related to
                    politics, data science (anything related to science tbh),
                    and games.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    If you'd like to talk then hit me up with a message! I'll be
                    happy to respond.
